# Training Course Notes: Whole Brain Thinking Model 

I recently participated in a training course which related to leadership. The most thing I learned is a thinking model which called Whole Brain Thinking.

> “The awareness of one’s own thinking style and the thinking styles of others combined with the ability to act outside of one’s preferred thinking style is known as Whole Brain Thinking.”  -- Ned Herrmann

Ned Herrmann originated Whole Brain® Thinking in 1979. In 1999, IBM adopted Herrmann’s Whole Brain® Thinking model and the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) as a way to develop more agile leaders.  Herrmann's book also revised in 2015 by Ann Herrmann-Nehdi.

### Thinking Model

Here is the 4 part of thinking model. The compose by 2 pairs of opposite preference. Blue/Red and Yellow/Green. You can't get high preference in both opposite preferences.

### Know yourself
I was asked to finish the HBDI test before this training. Here is my result:

As the result, I'm a relatively balanced person. The dotted line means how your preference would change while you are under stress.
In high preference are. You need less energy to do the things. Maybe talking to others all day is not a big deal if you have a high preference in the red area.
But the point is **this test only shows your preference, not if you are good or bad.**

#### Use the Framework
#### Client-Centric Presentation 
I'm working in IT consultant which is a client facing job. Have an analysis for your client and get out of your comfort zone to fit your client testy. Every client has a different expectation like below:

#### What your team member's thinking model is?
Finally, I'd like to use this framework to my team member. I really didn't have an awareness about the this. I always ask every member for detail and due. Even though my member really needs to know where we are and where are we heading for. But after all. Green part preference is necessary for consultant industry. So just let them know and get them out of the comfort zone.
